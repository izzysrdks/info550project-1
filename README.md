## About
The repository contains scripts and data for generating a report about the results (including Manhattan plots, QQ plots, and tables of significant genes) of two Transcriptome-Wide Association Studies (TWAS); one on ovarian cancer, and one on breast cancer. The raw data file is found in the `raw_data` directory. Cleaned data and data used to generate plots and tables is located in `clean_data`. Figures generated by the code are saved in `figs`. R and Rmd scripts used in report generation are in `R`. The `biblio` folder contains a files for generating a bibliography, although generating the bibliography is not currently implemented.



## R packages
To analyze the data, the `R` packages "ggplot2", "knitr", "kableExtra" need to be installed. To do so, run the following:
``` bash
make install
```

<!-- To analyze the data you will need to install some `R` packages. The required packages can be installed using `R` commands.

``` r
installed_pkgs <- row.names(installed.packages())
pkgs <- c("ggplot2", "knitr", "kableExtra")
for(p in pkgs){
	if(!(p %in% install_pkgs)){
		install.packages(p)
	}
}
``` -->
<!-- 
## pandoc-citeproc (optional)
Report generation with citations and bibliography requires installing pandoc-citeproc.

### Ubuntu
``` bash
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install -y pandoc-citeproc
```

### macOS
``` bash
brew install pandoc-citeproc 
```
 -->

## Execute the analysis

<!-- ### With Citations/Bibliography (optional)
To execute the analysis, from the project folder run:
``` bash
Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('report.Rmd')"
```
### No Citations/Bibliography
To execute the analysis without parsing citations, from the project folder you can run: 
 -->
To execute the analysis, from the project folder you can run: 
``` bash
make report
```
The command will create a file called `report.html` output in your directory that contains the results.
<!-- Both commands will create a file called `report.html` output in your directory that contains the results. -->
